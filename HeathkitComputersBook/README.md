I've made a Youtube video on Emulating Heathkit Computers with MAME.

I have entered the source code for the Heathkit ROM code for the H8
(PAM-8), H88/89 (MTR88), Z89 (MTR89), and H19 terminal. It is based on
the source code listings published by Heathkit. The code can be
cross-assembled with the ASL assembler and produces binaries that
match the original ROMs. You can find the code here:

I recently (April 2024) acquired a Heathkit H89 and am restoring it.
Watch for YouTube videos documenting the process.
